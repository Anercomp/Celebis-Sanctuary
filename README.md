Gen 2 to Gen 3 Trade tool for Pokemon


The goal of this project is to create a device that has more or less the same form factor as the official Wireless Adapter to enable trade between generation 2 and generation 3.
It will buffer traded Pokemon and convert them from the generation 2 Pokemon data format to generation 3 by using the algorithms used by PKHex.
It will utilize a STM32F103C8T for cheap and easy DIY possibilities.
